    "title": "About Hoots and BB bots",
    "content": "Only users with the Organization Administrator privilege can manage hoots and BB Bots.\nTo increase the trust and confidence of your data consumers, add a trust badge on the dashboards, called a Hoot. Hoots let you curate the parts of the catalog that are important to the data consumers and surface them easily on the dashboards. These provide real-time information to users on the assets, without having to consult the catalog or constantly monitor channels like emails and slack messages for current status.\nThe Hoot badges are designed to be very simple, and provide 3 types of indicators to the users:\nHappy - Green status: The data is healthy and has no known issues.\nWarn -Yellow status: Is a warning that there might be issues and someone is looking into them and use the data with caution.\nSick - Red status: There are serious issues with the data and it needs attention.\nThese badges are available to all users even if they do not have access to the complete catalog. Users with the catalog access will be able to pop open a more detailed view go get detailed information about the resource from the catalog.\nSetting up a hoot is as simple as going to a resource in the catalog and clicking the Configure hoot button for it. For each Hoot, a corresponding BB Bot gets created in the Hoot Admin space. To further enhance the experience of the Hoot, you can create BB Bots manually and connect them with the hoot. You would want to do this in scenarios such as 1. you want to have the Hoot get more frequently updated than the catalog status update intervals. 2. You have not cataloged all the parts of the data pipeline.\nThe system provides an easy way to integrate with dbt cloud jobs. For example, let us say you have streaming data from your online sales that need to monitored more frequently because it is being used in some high value dashboards to make crucial business decisions through the day. For that reason you may have set a dbt job to run hourly. BB Bots provide a seamlessly integration with dbt cloud which allows you to hook into your jobs. We automatically map the outcomes of those jobs (OK, warn, error) to the states of the hoots (Happy, Sad, and Sick).\nThe BB Bots allows the data engineers to be proactive and quickly let stakeholders know about the state of things through automated real-time monitors. This way, data consumers stay aware of any issues proactively while data engineers can focus on investigating and addressing the root cause.\nFor more insights from our product experts, watch \"Is my data OK?\" Gain visibility into Schr\u00f6dinger's data box through automated data health\u00a0updates\nHoots provide trust in the governance of the data product. If a stakeholder sees the Hoot they know the product is being monitored by the data team and they can quickly get a color-coded signal regarding the health of the data product. Red = sick, Green = happy, Yellow = sad. These correspond with the Negative, Positive, and Neutral asset status available for catalog resources.\nThe BB Bots provide a way for the DataOps team to chain together real-time monitoring and messaging from various sources - so even more than the catalog status.\nHoot Usage gives data teams a quick pulse on their ROI and which products are getting utilized.\nBusiness users: As data and analytics are being pushed to more and more rank-and-file employees, people with little to no data literacy are now expected to make sense of this information. The hoots provide the simplest, lowest cognitive load way for these users to know if they can trust a report. And if they have a question, they can see the Hoot as the icon for help and trust in data.\nData teams: Data teams have to be reactive as business needs for data change constantly. Business priorities and initiatives are fluid. Data teams also have to contend with the rise of \"shadow BI\" - people promoting alternate data to support their personal theories or agendas. The hoots are data teams' stamp of approval on a report, signaling to users that the information could be trusted.\nAs a business user or stakeholder, you need to quickly understand if the data product is trustworthy and governed. I want to know quickly if there are any known issues, what the terms mean, and where I can find more information. The Hoot helps you trust and understand.\nAs a data team member, you need to quickly communicate known issues in your data pipeline that affect the status or health of a data product. You also don\u2019t want to have to answer the same questions over and over and want to spend your time doing more proactive work, rather than reacting to questions that the catalog could answer for the user. The BB Bots help you communicate trust and encourage more self-service by utilizing the catalog.\nAs a data team or data product manager, you need to understand which reports are the most utilized so that you can monitor them and keep them healthy. You also need to understand which are the least utilized so that you can decide what to deprecate and retire. You also need to see which have the most downtime status, so you can understand where to prioritize my team's work. The Hoots Usage helps me make decisions about how to manage my data products.\ndata.world University!\nCheck out our DataOps and BB Bots course.",

    "title": "Technical Overview: Data pipeline concepts",
    "content": "To prepare the data used in a given data product, the data pipeline goes through a series of data processing steps that extract the data from one place, do some transformations on the data, and/or load the data in some other place to be used by the next data processing step. This is what is referred to as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). For example, a data pipeline may look like this.\nFor each data processing step, you can configure a BB bot to watch for the successful execution of that step and to collect specific information related to the execution (bb bot metadata). Each bb bot reports its information to the hoot app. The hoot app maintains an association between bb bots and the hoots for the reports that use the output data produced by its associated data processing step, either directly or indirectly.\nWhen a bb bot reports some issue with the data or with the execution of the data processing step, the hoot app forwards that information to the hoots that are associated with that bb bot. The hoot app automatically updates the hoot Badge to reflect the new information.\nYes!\nIn cases where the data produced by some data processing step is used by multiple reports, the hoot for each report can be connected to the bb bot related to that data processing step. When the BB bot indicates a concern with the data processing, all hoots will be informed of the situation.\nFor example, in the pipeline above, a BB bot associated with the Tableau extract will report any issues to the hoot associated with the Tableau report. If the analyst develops another dashboard that uses the same Tableau extract, then the hoot for the new dashboard can connect directly to the same Tableau extract BB bot.\nA data processing step extracts data either from direct inputs or from data loaded by another data processing step. When data processing step B extracts data loaded earlier by data processing step A, then you can reflect this relationship in the BB bots for the two steps. hoot allows you to specify this relationship by defining the BB bot for step B as being directly downstream from the BB bot for step A, or equivalently, defining the BB bot for step A as being directly upstream from the BB bot for step B.\nFor example, a BB bot associated with the Python script in the above pipeline would be directly upstream from a BB bot associated with the dbt processing step. A BB bot associated with the dbt processing step would be directly downstream from a BB bot associated with the Python script.\nBy defining the direct upstream-downstream relationships between BB bots, you can build a BB bot model that reflects the actual flow of data in your data pipeline.\nThe BB bot relationships help the hoot app understand the effects of reported issues more accurately, based on a better understanding of the pipeline timing and execution.\nConsider our case above with data processing Step A upstream of data processing step B. When step B reads the output data from step A, this happens at a particular point in time T. Later, Step A may run again and refresh its output. Then, even later at the end of the pipeline, the final product incorporates the version of the data from time T into the final data product. When hoot displays the hoot Badge on the data product, what the hoot Badge shows should reflect the state of the step A BB bot at time T, rather than the state at the time the hoot Badge is being rendered. The upstream-downstream relationships between the BB bots, together with their historical states, enable hoot to take this timing issue into account.",

They have a 1:1 relationship with the cataloged resource. When a user clicks on a Hoot badge in their BI dashboards, a Hoot details page pops up. This small page provides the end-user with more information (link to the catalog, lineage, related glossary terms, etc).\nThe badge is an embeddable web object that can be added to any data product (for example, Tableau Dashboards, Power BI Reports, etc.) that allows tiled or floating web objects.\nTo create a hoot:\nBrowse to the resource for which you want to configure the hoot.\nCheck if the Resource has a status. If not, you must consider setting a Status as the status of the resource in the catalog determines the status of the hoot.\nFrom the Settings tab, go to the Hoots section.

A corresponding BB Bot also gets created for the hoot.\nIf the resource does not have a status configured, the hoot is created with a Sad status (yellow color).\nClick the Manage tag button to assign tags to the hoot. From the Manage tag window, select an existing tag or type in a new tag name and assign it to the hoot.\nClick the Preview button to see a preview of the Hoot on a web page.\nClick the View in data.world button to go back to the resource in data.world.\nTo embed the hoot:\nFrom the Hoot details page, copy the Hoot URL or the Markdown for the hoot.

Click the Update Hoot button.\nThere are different ways in which the hoot status can changes:\nWhen the status of resource is changed in the catalog. Anytime the status of the connected resource is changed in the catalog, the hoot status changes immediately to reflect the latest status to the users of the data product where the hoots are embedded.\nWhen the status of hoot is changed manually from Hoot Admin app. A hoot admin can decide to intervene in the automatic updates to intentionally inform the data product users about a status that is not reflected by the automated updates. For example, when a hoot a sick and all the issues are resolved, it might take for the automated process to be informed about the latest happy status. In such cases, the hoot admin can change the status to Happy manually so that the data product users can start using the dashboards with confidence. The manual chages are over written as soon as their an automatic update received from the data source.\nWhen you have other BB bots connected with the hoot and their status changes.

    "title": "Set up BB bots that depend on other BB bots",
    "content": "Many companies use a data collection process that takes many hours to complete, and then reports are updated with new data. A classic example of this would be having a daily ETL process followed by an update of data (more specific example: you run a daily data pipeline, and then extract this data into Tableau).\nA BB bot can be connected to one or more Upstream BB bot. When the current BB bot is updated through the API, it then will take into account information from its Upstream BB bots.\nSet up upstream BB bots:\nIn this example, we create two BB bots - Data pipeline and Extract\nNext, we set the Data Pipeline BB bot to be Upstream from the Extract BB Bot. On the Extract BB Bot page, click the Connect Upstream BB Bots button. In the Connect Upstream BB Bots window, select the Data pipeline BB bot.\nConnect the Extract BB bot to a Hoot.\nWhen an API updates, the Extract BB bot and information from Upstream BB bots, such as meta[lastest_record_at] and state are used to compute the current value for the Extract BB Bot.\nLet us walk through some changes and see what happens to the connected Hoot.\nSuccess scenario\nAfter being setup, one connected Hoot has a Happy state.\nLet us say the Data Pipeline runs, and sets the meta[lastest_record_at] record. Nothing changes yet on the connected Hoot, because an API hasn\u2019t updated the Downstream BB Bot yet.\nThe extract runs and calls the API on the Extract BB bot to say that everything is Happy. Now, since there is no latest_record_at set on the Extract BB bot, it consults the Upstream BB bots to find the latest latest_record_at value, and uses this for the Hoot. The Hoot state is Happy.\nFailure scenario\nLet us say, the next day the Data Pipeline fails. The Pipeline BB bot is Sick, but nothing changes yet on the connected Hoot because an API hasn\u2019t updated our Downstream BB bot yet.\nThen the extract runs and calls the API on the Extract BB bot to say that everything is Happy. But, first it consults Upstream BB bots to find the latest state value, and uses this for the Hoot, hence making it Sick.\nOnce the Data Pipeline BB bot turns back Happy, this will propagate with the Downstream Hoots when an API request is made to the Downstream BB bot.\nConclusion\nThis was a simple example using one Upstream BB bot. You can actually attach multiple Upstream BB bots and each of these can have Upstream BB bots of their own. Effectively you can have a whole graph of BB bots attached to your Hoots. If you want to get very granular, feel free to add many Upstream BB bot. But if you just need a few check points, you do not have to add these just for completeness sake. It is probably good to start small and simple, and then build up to the more complex cases as you get the hang of things.",
