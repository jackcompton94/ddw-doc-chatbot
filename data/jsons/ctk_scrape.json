    "content": "\u2757\ufe0fBeta feature!This is a Beta feature andis notgenerally available to all customers at this time.In this section we will walk you through the process of getting your system setup for processing and showing the collector output and the related UI elements (MDP) to your end users. In this example, we will use theTableaucollector. You can follow the same process for the other collectors in system.\u2757\ufe0fFeature availabilityCurrently this feature is available for the following collectors.AWS S3DatabricksdbtGoogle BigQueryMANTAMicrosoft SQL ServerOpenAPIOraclePostgreSQLPower BISalesforceSnowflakeTableauIf you want to use it for another collector, contact thedata.world support team.STEP 1: Check availability of datasets and projects for the data sourceFirst, we will check to make sure that the datasets and project for the data source are available and ready for use.\ud83d\udea7This task is performed in theCatalog sourcesorganization.In theCatalog Sourcesorganization, browse to theOrganization profilepage.From theResourcestab, check and verify that the following datasets and projects are available to you:Project:DDW Catalog TableauDataset for the Sandbox organization:DDW Tableau SandboxDataset for the Main organization:DDW Tableau Main\ud83d\udcd8Organizations with different names!If your organizations are named differently, the datasets will be named accordingly. For example, if the organization is namedGlobal, the dataset name will beDDW Tableau Global.STEP 2: Run the collector\ud83d\udea7This task is performed in theCatalog sourcesorganization.Run the collector.If you are running the collector usingCLI or YAML files., make sure:a.--site:The name for the data.world site into which you will load this catalog. For example, forhttps://YourSiteName.app.data.world/orgName, use--site=\"YourSiteName\". This parameter should not be used for the multi-tenant or VPC instances.b.--account: Is set to point to theCatalog sourcesorganization.c.--upload-location: Is set to the corresponding dataset for the collector available in the \u200bCatalog Sources\u200b\u200borganization. For example, for Tableau, it will beddw-tableau-catalog-sandboxfor theDDW Tableau Sandboxdataset orddw-tableau-mainfor theDDW Tableau Maindataset depending on which organization you want the output to show in.If you are running the collector using theConnection Manager:a.  Make sure you run the Connection Manager in theCatalog sourcesorganization.b. In the connection manager window, set the dataset asDDW Tableau Sandboxdataset orDDW Tableau Maindataset depending on which organization you want the output to show in.Once the collector has run successfully, browse to the \u200bcollector specific dataset in theCatalog Sources\u200b\u200b organization. In this example, it is theDDW Tableau Sandboxdataset orDDW Tableau Maindataset. Verify that the output of the collector has been added to the dataset.STEP 3: Add the metadata profile for the collector\ud83d\udea7This task is performed in theCatalog configurationorganization.In the \u200bCatalog Configuration\u200b\u200borganization, go to theMetadata profilescollection.On the Overview tab, click theEditbutton and from theSourcetab of the window, selectTableau. ClickSave.Next, in the \u200bCatalog Configuration\u200b\u200borganization, go to theddw-catalogsdataset.  Locate the syncsource-modules.ttlfile in the dataset and click theSync nowbutton. This will load your selected source modules into Catalog Config.You will see a collection with the name of the data source  (in this caseTableau) which has all the MDP configurations related to the data source is added to the organization.STEP 4: Adjust the Collector metadata profile for your business needs\ud83d\udea7This task is performed in theCatalog configurationorganization.Now we will review the contents of the Metadata profile to see if you want to make any changes. When you complete STEP 4, the MDP for the collector are added to 2 places in the organization.The collection specific for the collector, for example,Tableaucollection: This collection is created to preserve a pristine copy of the MDP related to the collector and it should be only used for reference and not edited.TheMetadata profilescollection: An entity must be in theMetadata profilecollection in order for it to sync to your destination organizations for the collector outputs. Therefore, if you want tohidean entity or relationship in your destination organization without deleting it, it can simply be removed from thisMetadata profilecollection.STEP 5: Publish the MDP and collected metadata to end users\ud83d\udea7This task is performed in theMainorSandboxorganization.In theMainorSandboxorganization, go to theddw-catalogsdataset.In the dataset, find the matching file for the collector, and clickSync now.View the results\ud83c\udf89You can now browse to theSandboxorMainorganization and view the metadata collected by theTableaucollector.",
